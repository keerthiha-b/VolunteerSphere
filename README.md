# Volunteer Sphere App

## Introduction
Volunteer Sphere is a mobile application designed to connect volunteers with opportunities in their local community. Users can find volunteer events on a map, sign up for them, and track their participation and achievements through a point system and leaderboard. The app also features missions that users can complete to earn additional points and badges.

## Features
- **Opportunity Discovery**: Users can view available volunteer opportunities on an interactive map and through a list sorted by proximity and interest.
- **Sign-Up and Tracking**: Users can sign up for volunteer opportunities and track their participation directly through the app.
- **Missions and Points**: Users can undertake missions related to different themes (e.g., environmental, educational) and earn points that contribute to a leaderboard.
- **User Accounts**: Profiles where users can view their participation history, upcoming events, and mission progress.
- **Admin Panel**: Admins can post new opportunities, manage existing listings, and track user participation.

## Technologies Used
- **React Native**: For building the mobile application.
- **Node.js**: Backend API server.
- **MongoDB**: Database for storing user data and volunteer opportunities.
- **Express**: Framework used to build the backend.
- **Render**: Hosting and runtime for the backend.

## Setup and Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**
2. **Change to the Directory**
   ```bash
   cd volunteersphere-app
   ```
4. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
6. **Start the Project with Expo**
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
